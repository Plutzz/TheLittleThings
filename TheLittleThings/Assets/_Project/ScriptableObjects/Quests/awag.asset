  DisplayDescription: "\u201CWe have obtained the coordinates of the largest ICG
    era cache to date. The acquisition of this cache would be a great asset to the
    company. Your mission will be to secure the cache location from any intruders
    and hand the cache\u2019s contents to us afterwards.  A small garrison of unknown
    assets guard the cache. Intel says that they\u2019re likely old automated ICG
    defense drones, and shouldn\u2019t put up much of a fight.\u201D  \u201CComplete
    this final mission and you will be rewarded with enough to live a comfortable
    life for the rest of time.\u201D "
